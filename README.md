A short program to convert color declarations in CSS files from hexadecimal to rgb form.
The primary objective is to give me more exposure to hexadecimal as an output format for binary data, in a realistic context by trying to solve the problem in a way where I do the hexadecimal to decimal conversion with minimal use of library functions.
